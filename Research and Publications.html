				<Strong> Abstract:  </strong> Adopting appropriate openness design strategies, which fulfill open-innovation objectives while maintaining quality requirements, calls for deliberate analysis of openness requirements from early on in opening up software platforms. We propose to treat openness as a distinct class of non-functional requirements, and to refine and analyze it in parallel with other design concerns using a goal-oriented approach. We extend the Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) analysis method with a new set of catalogues for specifying and refining openness requirements in software platforms. We apply our approach to revisit the design of data provision service in two real-world open software platforms and discuss the results.</p>

				<Strong> Abstract:  </strong> Opening up software platforms to third-party applications often involves difficult trade-offs between openness requirements and critical design concerns such as security, performance, privacy, and proprietary ownership. Deliberate assessment of these trade-offs is crucial to the ultimate quality and viability of an open software platform. We propose to treat openness as a distinct class of non-functional requirements, and to model and analyze openness requirements and related trade-offs using a goal-oriented approach. The proposed approach allows to refine and analyze openness requirements in parallel with other competing concerns in designing software platforms. The refined requirements are used as criteria for selecting appropriate design options. We demonstrate our approach using an example of designing an open embedded software platform for the automotive domain reported in the literature. The proposed approach allows to balance the fulfillment of interacting requirements in opening up platforms to third-party products, and to determine “good-enough” and “open-enough” platform design strategies.

	             <Strong> Abstract:  </strong> It has become an increasingly common practice that software companies collaborate with external developers to develop a software platform for a shared market, constituting software ecosystems. One main concern in adopting the practice of software ecosystem is how to attract external developers to a platform, and how to establish sustainable collaborative relationships with them. We discuss that explicating and in-depth analysis of developers’ objectives and decision criteria can facilitate the design of sustainable collaborations in software ecosystems. Scenarios from Apple iOS and Google Android ecosystems are used for illustration.

	            <Strong> Abstract:  </strong> It has become an increasingly common practice for software companies to collaborate with external developers in order to develop software platforms for a shared market, constituting software ecosystems. Creating and sustaining a software ecosystem is a challenging problem that involves numerous technical, organizational, and business concerns. To support the systematic design of software ecosystems, modeling is a crucial tool. In this paper, we (a) identify a set of descriptive and analytical requirements raised in the design of software ecosystems; (b) review several modeling techniques used for describing and examining software ecosystems; and (c) assess the support of the reviewed techniques towards addressing the identified requirements. The results provide insight into the gaps between the issues raised in the design of software ecosystems, and the coverage of the studied techniques, suggesting an agenda for future research.

	            <Strong> Abstract:  </strong> As a software organization matures and expands, it often evolves through different styles of organization, for example, beginning with creative chaos as a start-up, then introducing disciplined processes to raise quality, and later regaining agility through light-weight practices. Recently, many firms join collaborative networks to develop software products and platforms for a shared market, constituting “Software Ecosystems”. At each stage of evolution, the software organization aims to overcome critical challenges faced in its earlier stages, while balancing business, organizational, social, and technical forces of change. To illustrate how the evolutionary trajectory of a software development firm is shaped by various interacting forces, we draw upon a longitudinal case study taken from the literature. We use the i* strategic actors modeling framework to help analyze the forces that trigger the transition from one organizational configuration to another.
