<!-- ///////  -->

<!-- Problem -->

<p id = "heading"> Specification: </p>

<p> 
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i. <br>

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction <br> 
(i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock),<br>
design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. <br>

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one. <br>
</p>

<!-- ///////  -->

<!-- Examples -->

<p id = "heading"> Examples: </p>

<p class = "strong" > Example 1: </p>
<p> 
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4] <br>
Output: 5 <br>
Explanation: <br>
Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5. <br>
Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price. <br>
</p>


<p class = "strong" > Example 2: </p>
<p>
Input: [7,6,4,3,1] <br>
Output: 0  <br>
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0. <br>
</p>

	<ol>
	
	<li> Go to the end of array. </li>
	<li> Find daily fluctuation for each day. <br>

	i.e, maximum ( daily fluctuation for the day, and daily fluctuation for the day + maxmimum accumulative fluctuation starting from the next day.) </li>
	
	<li> Return maximum accumulative fluctuation from among all the days.</li>
